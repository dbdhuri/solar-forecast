# Deep Learning for Solar Modeling

FlareNet defines an experimental environment for deep learning research with images of the sun. The initial problem introduced by the repository is x-ray flux prediction, i.e. solar flare prediction. However, the framework is appropriate for all solar modeling problems where the independent variables are solar images. Our purpose in publishing FlareNet is to facilitate collaboration between heliophysicists and deep learning researchers. We encourage anyone developing on top of this code base to open [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) to advance our collective efforts at understanding of solar physics.

**Citing:** We ask that anyone using this deep learning framework to cite FlareNet as the following:

## Usage ##

The core commands pertain to training, testing, and visualization. Each of these commands have a common set of parameters.

After completing installation, you run experiments by copying one of the network model folders and issuing training runs, with, for example, `python network_models/xray_flux_forecast/starting_point/network.py`.

## Installation ##

You can run FlareNet either on your local machine or on [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-ai/amis/) (AWS). In both instances you will need a large amount of disk storage (around a terabyte) for the files that will be downloaded.

### Local Setup ###

To setup FlareNet on your local machine, you should install Anaconda's Python. You should additionally install NVIDIA's compiler and CUDA libraries if you are training on a GPU.

Example setup script for a server that already has the core Nvidia software installed.

> wget https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda2-4.4.0-Linux-x86_64.sh; chmod a+x Anaconda2-4.4.0-Linux-x86_64.sh; ./Anaconda2-4.4.0-Linux-x86_64.sh

> conda update --all  
> conda install astropy pydot graphviz keras  
> pip install tensorflow tensorflow-gpu feather-format  

Once you successfully install, you should then clone this repository and add it to your python path.

> git clone REPOSITORY_REFERENCE_HERE
> cd flarenet
> export PYTHONPATH=/PATH/TO/REPOSITORY/flarenet:$PYTHONPATH

You can add the line about exporting to your .bash_profile or .bashrc file so you will not need to type it in on every connection to your server.

Please open pull requests to correct this setup script based on your own experiences.

### AWS Setup ###

Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides cloud computing machines with powerful GPUs for training your models. We are working with the "AMI Deep Learning Image" for Amazon Linux that pre-packages CUDA 9, cuDNN 7, NCCL 2.0.5, NVidia Driver 384.81, and TensorFlow [master with enhancements for CUDA 9 support].

**Selecting your machine:** If you are on a budget, we recommend working with a p2.xlarge machine. These are equipped with K80 GPUs, which have more GPU memory than a single p3 machine. The p3 machines share GPU memory which makes them better when you use one of the more expensive machines. Either way, the memory available is the most important factor determining training efficiency for these solar problems. The images are large, multi-channeled, and noisy. The bigger the batch size, the better. Also note, you can use the cheapest instance when downloading data to Amazon storage. You can switch to a bigger instance for training after you have downloaded all the data you want.

Steps:

1. [Create an account with AWS](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?nc2=h_ct&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fregistration-confirmation#/start)
2. [Create a machine instance](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-2#LaunchInstanceWizard:) Select the "Deep Learning AMI (Amazon Linux) Version 1.0 - ami-77eb3a0f" instance from the list.
3. Select the hardware you want to deploy to, then launch the instance. See "Selecting your machine" above for details.
4. Connect to the newly launched instance over SSH. This should be something like `ssh ec2-user@YOUR-MACHINE-HERE.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com`
5. Activate the software required by FlareNet `source activate tensorflow_p27`
6. Clone the FlareNet repository, `git clone https://github.com/nasa-fdl/flarenet.git`
7. Change into the cloned directory `cd flarenet`
8. Add the flarenet directory to the Python search path. `export PYTHONPATH=/home/ec2-user/flarenet:$PYTHONPATH`
9. Install the required libraries with the following 3 commands `conda update --all`, `conda install astropy pydot graphviz`, `pip install feather-format`
9. Now we are going to create the disk that will store all the SDO images we download. Since we may eventually want to migrate the data from Elastic Block Storage (EBS; which is faster for an individual machine but doesn't scale to multiple machines) to Elastic File System (EFS; which scales to a cluster of GPU machines), we are going to create a separate EBS volume. The separate EBS volume will make it easier to prototype on cheap hardware, then scale to progressively more expensive GPU instances. When the largest instance offered by Amazon does not suffice, we will want to migrate to EFS (costs 3x more) and begin cluster computing on multiple machines. For now, we recommend going to the [EBS volume creation page](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-2#CreateVolume:) and creating a separate volume. Start out with a small volume size and dial it up later as you download more SDO images.
10. [Attach the new EBS volume](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-using-volumes.html) to the running machine by clicking on the EBS volume then selecting the "attach" action. Change the "Device" setting from `/dev/sdf` to `/dev/sdo`.
11. Now we are going to format the device volume as attached to our machine with the command `sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdo`
12. Now create a mount point for the drive with `sudo mkdir /data`.
13. Mount the drive to the mount point with `sudo mount /dev/xvdo /data`
14. Now you have the machine to run experiments and the place to store data. It is time to issue a test run: `python network_models/synthetic/version0/network.py` This should start training on a synthetic solar activity generator.
15. Now we are going to start working with the SDO data, but first we need to download it from servers hosted at Stanford University. First you will need to decide where these data will go. Open the config.yml file found at the root of the repository and change the path for `aia_path` to read `aia_path: /data/`
16. Now it is time to actually download the data. This download operation can take a long time, so we recommend starting the operation in a [screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/screen.html#Overview) session. If you don't want to figure out screen you can just have the terminal window sit open for a few days. Issue the following command to begin downloading all the flaring instances: `python dataset_models/sdo/download/download_aia.py`.
16. Now let's separate the training and the testing sets with the following command, `python dataset_models/sdo/structure_data.py`. If you do not download the whole dataset this will default to separating 100 flaring cases into the validation set, or 10 percent of all the data (whichever is smaller).
17. Now it is time to generate the dependent variable file based on the data you downloaded. This will be pulled from the GOES satellites, which measure solar xray flux output. Issue `python tools/xray_flux_forecast/v4_find_ys.py` and the dependent variable files will be created.
18. Now you can do a test run of training on the full data with `python network_models/xray_flux_forecast/starting_point/network.py`.

## File Structure ##

Assuming you are working on the x-ray flux prediction problem, you should generally start by copying the "starting_point" project to a new directory. It includes a rudimentary network specification from which you can customize. Issue this command from the root of the repository: `cp network_models/xray_flux_forecast/starting_point network_models/xray_flux_forecast/my_network_experiment`

## Deep Learning Glossary ##

* [Keras](https://keras.io/): A library for specifying neural networks. It build on top of TensorFlow and other Deep Learning libraries with a cleaner way of specifying neural network architectures. If you want to know how to specify a new neural network architecture on FlareNet, then you should look at the Keras API.
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/): Keras builds on top of TensorFlow and TensorFlow provides the efficient methods for training and evaluating neural networks on either GPUs or CPUs. You will need to know TensorFlow if there is functionality that you need to build that is not supported by Keras.
* [CUDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA): CUDA is the low level language for parallel computing developed by NVIDIA. You should not need to develop anything in this language since TensorFlow abstracts away these complexities.
* Is something not covered here? You can add additional terms by opening a pull request. Opening these simple pull requests is a great way to open the discussion.

## Hardware Requirements ##

Most of the models only train efficiently with a good GPU. FlareNet was originally developed for the hardware below, but you can run these experiments with less impressive infrastructure. You can also run these experiments with a CPU, but it will take several orders of magnitude longer to complete. During our initial phase of development we were provided with 16 of these machines by IBM.
